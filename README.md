# Memory Game
A simple memory game meant to improve the user's recall and typing speed.

## Features
- Flashes a set of sentences from the books in `src/data/books/`
- Scores the user's ability to recall the passage they pick.
- Tracks user score and performance.
- I play it on the console, but it was designed to be easily adaptable to any input/output handling, and at some point soon I'll add a simple UI that it will look just like a terminal window.

## Configuration
All configs are defined in `src/config/config.py`, 

Books:
-- Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone
-- The Unbearable Lightness of Being
-- The Art of Fielding
-- Pride and Prejudice

Gameplay config(s):
- PASSAGE_COUNT â€“ Number of sentences the user is shown per round (default: 3)
- PASSAGE_LENGTH -- Length of the passages user is shown (default: min 40 chars, a decent sized sentence.)
- ROUNDS_PER_GAME -- What is sounds like, have many rounds there are per game.

## Setup
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd memorygame
pip install .
python main.py
